# UniAlgorithm Project

## Directory Overview

This directory contains C++ solutions for algorithmic problems, likely from the Baekjoon Online Judge. The problems are organized into subdirectories based on the week they were assigned or solved.

The code is written in C++ and each file represents a self-contained solution to a specific problem.

## Key Files

*   `3week, 4week/baekjoon1074.cpp`: Solution for Baekjoon problem 1074.
*   `3week, 4week/baekjoon1493.cpp`: Solution for Baekjoon problem 1493.
*   `3week, 4week/numOfPaper.cpp`: Solution for a problem related to counting paper.
*   `5week/baekjoon1707.cpp`: Solution for Baekjoon problem 1707.
*   `5week/baekjoon1987.cpp`: Solution for Baekjoon problem 1987.
*   `test.cpp`: A file for testing and experimenting with C++ code.

## Building and Running

Each C++ file can be compiled and run individually. There is no central build system.

To compile and run a file (e.g., `baekjoon1987.cpp`), you can use a C++ compiler like `g++`:

```bash
# Compile the C++ file
g++ 5week/baekjoon1987.cpp -o baekjoon1987

# Run the compiled executable
./baekjoon1987
```

**Note:** You may need to provide input to the program as specified by the problem description on the online judge.
